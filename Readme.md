# How to use All-Day header to display scheduled time statistics


<p>Problem :</p>
<p>It would be good to display how much time you have in use (% wise) in your schedule. When an appointment is added/changed/deleted for each resource it will calculate the appointments on the days that have been changed against your total time available and get a % which will be added to the top of the schedule. When you have less than 50% available it will show yellow and when you go over 50% it will show in red.</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>You can utilize the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraSchedulerSchedulerControl_CustomDrawDayViewAllDayAreatopic">SchedulerControl.CustomDrawDayViewAllDayArea event</a> to draw this statistics in the All-Day appointments area. Then, you can collect appointments for a particular day usingÂ the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraSchedulerSchedulerStorageBase_GetAppointmentstopic">SchedulerStorageBase.GetAppointments method</a>. To calculate work time loads, use the<strong>Â DevExpress.XtraScheduler.Tools.IntervalLoadRatioCalculator</strong> instance.<br /> This following picture showsÂ the resulting application.<br /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevExpress-Examples/how-to-use-all-day-header-to-display-scheduled-time-statistics-e121/13.1.4+/media/0d43b8e0-d3c9-11e4-80bf-00155d62480c.png"></p>
